                    The following is a summary of the lore found within the game of Divinity Original Sin 2, through
                    conversations with characters and reading of the various books, related to the ancient Eternals and
                    the Seven. Do not keep reading if you want to try and discover it for yourself through play!</p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    Thousands of years before the recorded history of the current races, the Eternal race reigned
                    supreme. Their magical and mechanical technology was so advanced that they could effectively make
                    themselves immune to aging, hence being named Eternals, and none of the current races have ever been
                    able to replicate it. Their civilization was a monarchy, with a King and seven Lords, and their
                    bodies had a very wide variety of forms; current-day Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Lizard-Men and
                    Orcs all had ancestors within this one society. They were also so advanced that they actually
                    created certain forms of life itself, basic bipedal humanoid creatures to act as what they would
                    call "source vats", but the Eternals considered these creations little more than beasts.
                </p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    And Fane - the very Fane you can play as - single-handedly triggered events that set off the
                    destruction of it all.
                </p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    Fane was a magical researcher in close ties with the ruling family. Through his studies he
                    discovered the Veil of Creation, and the power of Source and Void restrained behind it. He believed
                    that the Eternals race could greatly advance by harnessing that power, and went to the King to
                    request resources and people be set to the task of doing so. But the King refused, considering it
                    too dangerous to attempt. Very passionate about his discovery, Fane then went to the Seven Lords and
                    asked for their help instead. Enthralled by the potential power Fane revealed to them, they readily
                    agreed and collectively confronted the King, trying to change his mind. When he refused, the Lords
                    gathered their forces and started a civil war.
                </p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    The war was catastrophic. The entire Eternal civilization became involved, and practically destroyed
                    itself. During the war the Seven already began to harness the power Fane had revealed to them and
                    started growing in power significantly, which eventually led them to victory. In the end the Seven,
                    led by Amadia, threw the King and all of the other Eternals into the Void, and sealed them there.
                    Aetera, who was loyal to the King (and you find in the Ancient Temple below the Blackpits in-game)
                    tried to undo what the Seven had done, and also started developing a weapon that could destroy the
                    now heavily-empowered Seven Lords: the Aeteran. But before she could use it she was discovered and
                    entombed. She fully remembers how Fane was involved with these events, and profoundly hates him for
                    it.
                </p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    With their civilization now in complete ruins and most of the sentient life in the world wiped out,
                    the Seven (except potentially Amadia, what she did in that time is unclear) went their separate ways
                    and started creating the current races, modelled after themselves: Rhalic created the Humans, Duna
                    the Dwarves, Zorl-Stissa the Lizardmen, Vrogir the Orcs, Tir Cendelius the Elves and Xantessa the
                    Goblins. According to Aetera later their work was "sloppy", and not as good as what the original
                    Eternal King could have done. The created races also subsequently started worshipping their
                    corresponding Lord as a God, which the Seven also encouraged, revelling in the adoration. Hence the
                    mythos of the Seven Gods were created.
                </p>
                <p  class="texto2">
                    At some point during this time Fane ended up entombed for quite some time, and lost most of his
                    memory of the events. It is also why when he is awakened during the events of the game that he
                    expresses great confusion when he sees statues and idols of the original Seven Lords being
                    worshipped as "gods". But speaking with Aetera reminds him of all of it.
                </p>
                <p class="texto2">
                    Finally, the Eternal King is still alive, stuck in the Void. It is suspected that his attempts to
                    escape are what are causing cracks in the Veil and letting so many Voidwoken out whenever Source is
                    used.
